# gimmegit

gimmegit is a command-line tool for cloning GitHub repos and organizing branches. You might find gimmegit interesting if:

  - You usually work within forks of upstream repos
  - You want several branches of the same fork checked out in parallel (as with [git-worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree))
  - You frequently review branches from the forks of other contributors

> [!WARNING]  
> gimmegit is in early development. Expect bugs and breaking changes!
